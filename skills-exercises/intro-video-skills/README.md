Hello,
Myself sanket raut. I am from Nagpur,Maharashtra.

I am Laravel developer with 4+ years of experience. I work on technology such PHP,Laravel,Bootstrap,
Javascript, Jquery etc. I am using javascript from last 4 years but not on advance level, it is mostly
for UI interactivity level. I have also worked on VueJs, its been 1 year on that. So, I pretty familiar
with Javascript and working on it.

There was one Online Quiz application project, that i built. That was one of my best & intersting project.
I have built complete project from scratch with frontend and backend. The UI i have built using existing
bootstrap template but it was much better with my concept. It as admin, to manage categories, questions,
students, subscriptions etc.
on frontend student can take quizzes and also they earn points based on the exam they solved according difficulty
level. Also, it has random daily challenges like solve 2 Match Hard Quiz + 1 English Medium level quiz to earn
500 coins etc. so If student complete that day challenge, he wins points. And that points can be redeem based
on small shop available managed from admin.
